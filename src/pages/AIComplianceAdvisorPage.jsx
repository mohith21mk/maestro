1. **Single-Source Dependencies (${singleSourceCount} Materials)** \`[BUSINESS DATA]\`

   - *Impact*: In case of supplier operational disruption or logistics lockouts, manufacturing operations face immediate line-stoppage once current buffer inventory exhausts.

2. **Lead Time Buffer Deficit** \`[SUPPLIER METRIC]\`
   - Primary suppliers average **14–21 days lead time**, exceeding the safety stock reserve window of 7 days.
   - *Recommendation*: Increase buffer safety stock by 10 days and qualify alternative regional suppliers.

3. **Vendor Statutory Compliance Gaps (${missingDocCount} Expired / Missing Documents)** \`[REGULATORY SOURCE]\`
   - Missing GST clearance certificates or ISO/MSME certifications from key suppliers can trigger tax input credit (ITC) blockages under Section 16(2) of the CGST Act.

#### 🛡️ Autonomous Recommendations & HITL Action Proposals:
* **Create Action Proposal**: Issue an RFQ to qualify secondary regional suppliers from the MSME databank.
* **Buffer Adjustment**: Automate purchase order triggers at minimum reorder thresholds.
